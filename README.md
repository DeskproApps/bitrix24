## **About the app**
Bitrix24 enhances collaboration and customer relationship management for businesses. With Deskpro's Bitrix24 integration, agents can effortlessly access contact data, streamlining workflows and improving user interactions.

## **Setting up the app in Deskpro**
You can follow our [set-up guide](./SETUP.md) for a step-by-step guide to setting up the Bitrix24 app in Deskpro.

## Development

### With DevContainers (Recommended)
To make development easier and avoid version conflicts, we recommend using **DevContainers** for local development. This approach ensures that everyone on the team uses the same environment, reducing setup issues and version mismatches between dependencies.

#### Why use DevContainers?
- **Consistency:** All developers work in the same environment, with the same versions of dependencies, tools, and configurations.
- **Speed:** The DevContainer setup is quick to start, letting you focus on coding rather than environment setup.
- **Isolation:** Avoid conflicts between different versions of Node.js, PNPM, or other dependencies by using the predefined container setup.

#### Getting Started with DevContainers
1. Ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.
2. Open the project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. If you have the **Remote - Containers** extension installed, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) should automatically detect the `.devcontainer` configuration in this project and prompt you to reopen the folder in the container.
4. After opening the project in the DevContainer, run:
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

You should now be able to view the app in your browser. For more information about developing [Deskpro apps](https://www.deskpro.com/apps), [Visit the docs](https://support.deskpro.com/ga/guides/developers/anatomy-of-an-app).

### Natively
_We recommend using the DevContainer mentioned above for Consistency, Speed and Isolation._

This app was developed primarily using **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Vite**.

#### Setup
To run this project locally:

 ```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DeskproApps/bitrix24.git

# Change to the project directory
cd bitrix24

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the development server
pnpm start
```

You should now be able to view the app in your browser. For more information about developing [Deskpro apps](https://www.deskpro.com/apps), [Visit the docs](https://support.deskpro.com/ga/guides/developers/anatomy-of-an-app).

### Testing
We've included `jest` to run tests. It will look anywhere in `/src` for test suite files ending in `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts`.

You can run all tests using:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Versioning
Every app deployment requires that the version property in the `manifest.json` file be updated to reflect the new app version. This is so Deskpro can detect changes and add/upgrade apps accordingly. As such, we've made altering versions easy by having CI make the actual version change for you. Here's what we do:

* We increment **patch** versions, i.e. 1.0.1, automatically. This is the default
* **Minor** versions, i.e. 1.1.0, are incremented if you add the `minor-version` GitHub label to your PR
* **Major** versions, i.e. 2.0.0, are incremented if you add the `major-version` GitHub label to your PR
